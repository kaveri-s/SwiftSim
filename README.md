# SwiftSim
Simulation and benchmarking for Swift workload based on a predefined net topology

# Intro
Cloud computing enables global access to a shared pool of resources such
as servers, storage, applications. The evaluation of policies and testing of
algorithms directly on the cloud in an exhaustive manner is not feasible. It
involves lot of resources. An approach to this problem, would be to use a
simulator that simulates and provides a platform for validating the
environment. Our project aims to extend OpenSim, a simulator for OpenStack,
by integrating the OpenStack Swift code to provide an effective environment
for simulation of OpenStack interactions with Swift.
